\chapter{Overview}
The purpose of this document is to provide a detailed test plan for the mcmaster-text-to-motion-database including each subsection that makes up the combined project. The content of this document is covered below:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Our proof of concept is described in Section 2.
  \item The set of tests that will test the system as a whole are in Section 3.
  \item The tests that ensure proper constraints on the system are in Section 4.
  \item The set of tests that verify functional requirements have been met are in Section 5.
  \item The set of tests that verify non-functional requirements have been met are in Section 6.
  \item A timeline of the test plan is given in Section 7.
  \item Appendix is found in Section 8.
\end{itemize} 

\section{Test Case Format}
The format for the automated test case and manual test case can be found below with descriptions for each section of a test case:

\testauto{
        name = {Test Name},
        desc = {A description of what is being automatically tested},
        type = {The type of test (Automated)},
        init = {The intial state of the system for the test},
        input = {The input that is required to complete the test},
        output = {The desired output from the system},
        pass = {What conditions must be met in order to be a success},
        reqnum = {The requirement number}
}

\testmanual{
        name = {Test Name},
        desc = {A description of what is being manually tested},
        type = {The type of test (Manual)},
        user = {The user that will preform the test},
        pass = {What the user will use to determine if the test was passed},
        reqnum = {The requirement number}
}

\section{Automated Testing}
Automated testing for this project will be utilized in each testing sections and require some software or custom application in order to preform the testing. This testing is critical to each section of the project and are divided into seperate requirement sections. The division is required in order to ensure that testing can occur while still in development.

\subsection{Testing Tools}

\section{Manual Testing}
Manual testing will be used in the project when automated test would require too much additional development, or expertise that can not be represented through an application. These tests will be done by the external supervisor and his research team along with user test groups in order to remove any bias that the development team would have.

\subsection{User Experience Testing}
Some manual testing will consist of a user experience test in order to assess the expierence of the project. They will be asked about the look and feel of the project website, gathering information, and other functionality that is incorperated. Because of the range of complexity within the project the test groups will have to contain different expertise and knowledge about software development.

\section{List of Constants}

\chapter{Proof of Concept Testing}
Before the project can enter a serious stage of development, a proof of concept must be accomplished in order to prove that difficulties can be overcome in order to prove the projects need and use. Sections of this proof of concept is explained in more detail below.

\section{Significant Risks}
The significant risks of this project can be seperated into three sections represented by the website, database, and deep learning network. The significatn risks for each section and for the project as a whole are shown below:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Linking the three major sections together in order to have them working in tandom is largest risk to the projects success as one failing will directly impact the others.
  \item The website must use a form of query to the database in order to correctly return the desired information.
  \item The database must contain a pairing of video and text descriptions in order to provide the correct information to the users and developers.
  \item Deep learning and pose estimation require a steep learning curve.
\end{itemize}

\section{Demonstration Plan}
In order to show that the significant risks can be overcome the demostration will have a set of deliverables that will provide the base for how successful the proof of concept is. Each key deliverable can be found below:

\begin{itemize}
  \item A functional website, as an interface for running pose estimation.
  \item Said website should contain a database.
  \item The ability to upload images and videos, and to update the database with those uploaded data.
  \item The ability to run human pose estimation on any uploaded image and video. Human pose estimation can be explained on as, the skeletons and joints of any humans in thoe uploaded media will be indicated visually.
  \item The ability to search for uploaded images and videos through some means, e.g. by tag or name.

\section{Proof of Concept Test}
Each deliverable has a test case that should be passed in order to determine how successful the proof of concept is. The test cases are considered to be simple manual tests as the group members will be preforming them in isolation or during the demonstration.
