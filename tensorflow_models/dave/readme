imanolspipeline.py now can read from the pos_DB.sqlite database and get 
files and coordinates to produce training data for a session that trains a
neuarl network

Problems: 1) FLIC images have to be rescaled to 256 x 256 and the pose 
coordinates haven't been changed after the scaling so the coordinates are
currently wrong

	2) it is supposed to also generate a test set to test the 
	optimization but it doesn't do this yet.

	3) it grabs the same 20 files each time it's called I should 
	randomize the files it grabs (which is easy to do because the
	files are in a database with a primary key which ranges between 0 and 24000)

	4) currently the Guassian it creates is only for one limb position -- I need
	to create a label for each limb we are considering but it made sense to start
	with just one


The pose_DB.sqlite contains entries for the pose values of the 

updateDatabase.py - adds all the columns for the pose parts in the database but doesn't add any data

putRightWrist.py - adds all of the data in PoseData folder into the database but the 
filepaths it uses are absolute so will only work on my computer unless the pathnames
are changed ( I set the filepath around line 101 if you want to change this)

printIt.py - this is the file I used just to check to see if the database entries
made sense

putFilesInDatabase I used to put the names of the jpeg files into the database

Also the database contains: columns
lwristx = 'left_x_wrist'
lwristy = 'left_y_wrist'
rwristx = 'right_x_wrist'
rwristy = 'right_y_wrist'
lelbowx = 'left_x_elbow'
lelbowy = 'left_y_elbow'
relbowx = 'right_x_elbow'
relbowy = 'right_y_elbow'
headx = 'x_head'
heady = 'y_head'
lshoulderx = 'left_x_shoulder'
lshouldery = 'left_y_shoulder'
rshoulderx = 'right_x_shoulder'
rshouldery = 'right_y_shoulder'
rhipx = "right_hip_x"
rhipy = "right_hip_y"
lhipx = "left_hip_x"
lhipy = "left_hip_y"
rknex = "right_knee_x"
rkney = "right_knee_y"
lknex = "left_knee_x"
lkney = "left_knee_y"
rankx =  "right_ankle_x"
ranky = "right_ankle_y"
lankx = "left_ankle_x"
lanky = "left_ankle_y"

as well as a filename column for the jpeg file in the FLIC database and a primary key index column.
