Currently a program to create heat maps was made and is in the file 
 heat_map_maker.py.

Within this file there is a function which reads joint positions from a database containing
joint positions and filenames of jpegs.

The joint posisitions are collected into separate np-arrays: one for x-coordinates and one for
y-coordinates.  Then using tensor manipulations (mostly matrix multiplications with constant tensors
and transposes) these lists are transformed into heat maps.

Bachs of these heatmaps are collected as well as tensors of images.  Every time the function 
_input_pipeline(database_access_file, data_path,  batch_length, image_dimension, rescale_size, num_channels, num_parts, stdev, gaussFact)

is called a new batch of heat maps or jpegs is gathered.  The images can then be passed through the convulutional network and the
L2 function can be called but currently it returns the value of infinity.  This could because of incomplete data in the 
FLIC database or because initial values of the convulutional network were not set properly so the output is too large.

Currently a method is needed that updates the weights everytime the function input_pipeline is called for the network to do any
learning.




The pose_DB.sqlite contains entries for the pose values of the 

updateDatabase.py - adds all the columns for the pose parts in the database but doesn't add any data

putRightWrist.py - adds all of the data in PoseData folder into the database but the 
filepaths it uses are absolute so will only work on my computer unless the pathnames
are changed ( I set the filepath around line 101 if you want to change this)

printIt.py - this is the file I used just to check to see if the database entries
made sense

putFilesInDatabase I used to put the names of the jpeg files into the database

Also the database contains: columns
lwristx = 'left_x_wrist'
lwristy = 'left_y_wrist'
rwristx = 'right_x_wrist'
rwristy = 'right_y_wrist'
lelbowx = 'left_x_elbow'
lelbowy = 'left_y_elbow'
relbowx = 'right_x_elbow'
relbowy = 'right_y_elbow'
headx = 'x_head'
heady = 'y_head'
lshoulderx = 'left_x_shoulder'
lshouldery = 'left_y_shoulder'
rshoulderx = 'right_x_shoulder'
rshouldery = 'right_y_shoulder'
rhipx = "right_hip_x"
rhipy = "right_hip_y"
lhipx = "left_hip_x"
lhipy = "left_hip_y"
rknex = "right_knee_x"
rkney = "right_knee_y"
lknex = "left_knee_x"
lkney = "left_knee_y"
rankx =  "right_ankle_x"
ranky = "right_ankle_y"
lankx = "left_ankle_x"
lanky = "left_ankle_y"

as well as a filename column for the jpeg file in the FLIC database and a primary key index column.
